  I don't have the ability to use words or phrases as I'm just a text-based AI and don't have the capability to speak or write in complete sentences. However, if we are talking about common phrases used by humans in conversation, some of the most overused ones include:

1. "I mean" - often used to clarify what was previously said but can sometimes add unnecessary complexity to a conversation
2. "Like" and "You know" - filler words that don't really add meaning but are commonly used in casual speech
3. "Very" or "really" followed by an adjective – these intensifiers can make statements stronger, but they're often overused to the point of being redundant
4. “Stuff” and “things” - vague placeholders that don’t add much meaning when used without context
5. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles as nouns – for example, using "learning" instead of "knowledge" or "experience." These verbs can sometimes be overused and make sentences less clear.

 [0, ' You\'re absolutely correct in identifying some common phrases that are often used excessively in human conversations. Here is a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. I mean - this phrase is commonly used to clarify what was previously said, but it can sometimes add unnecessary complexity and confusion to the conversation as it implies that what was originally stated may have been unclear or ambiguous.\n2. Like and You know - these are filler words often used in casual speech to indicate a similarity or agreement with something being discussed, or to show that one is thinking before speaking, but they don\'t really add much meaning when taken out of context.\n3. Very and Really followed by an adjective – these intensifiers can make statements stronger, but they are often overused to the point of becoming redundant as they can dilute the impact of a strong statement or emotion.\n4. Stuff and Things - These vague placeholders don\'t add much meaning when used without context and can lead to misunderstandings if not clarified adequately in the conversation.\n5. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles as nouns – for example, using "learning" instead of "knowledge" or "experience." While these verbs may be used correctly at times, overusing them can make sentences less clear and confusing to understand as they are not actually functioning as the intended part of speech.\n\nIt\'s essential to use language effectively in communication to ensure clarity and precision, rather than relying on filler words or repetitive phrases that don\'t add much meaning.', '\n\n']

iteration 2: 
 [1, ' It\'s true that those phrases are commonly used in human conversation. Here is some more information about each one:\n\n1. I mean: This phrase is often used to clarify what was previously said, but it can also add unnecessary complexity to a conversation because it implies that the previous statement may have been unclear or ambiguous. It\'s usually better to avoid using "I mean" and instead rephrase what you want to say clearly in the first place.\n2. Like and You know: These are filler words that don\'t add much meaning but are commonly used in casual speech as pause-fillers, signaling to the listener that more is coming or expressing uncertainty about something. However, they can make a conversation seem less polished or professional if overused.\n3. Very and Really: These intensifiers can make statements stronger when used appropriately, but they are often overused to the point of being redundant. Instead of saying "I\'m very hungry," it might be better to say "I\'m starving" or "I need food."\n4. Stuff and Things: These words can act as placeholders for more specific objects or concepts, but they are often used without context and can make a conversation seem vague or unclear. It\'s usually best to use more precise language instead of relying on these generic terms.\n5. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles: While these verbs can be useful when used appropriately, they can also cause confusion if overused and make sentences less clear because they don\'t have a distinct meaning as nouns do. It\'s usually better to use precise verb forms instead of relying on these ambiguous constructions.', '\n\n']

iteration 3: 
 [2, ' It\'s correct that in human conversation, there are some common phrases and words that get used frequently, often without adding much value to the discussion. Here are some examples:\n\n1. I mean - this phrase is often used when a speaker wants to clarify what they previously said or correct a misunderstanding. However, it can sometimes add unnecessary complexity to a conversation as it implies that there was confusion in the first place. A clearer and more direct way of communicating would be to simply rephrase what you meant without using "I mean."\n2. Like - this filler word is commonly used in casual speech but doesn\'t really add meaning on its own. It can sometimes indicate a comparison or an approximation, but it often gets overused and becomes unnecessary. A more precise way of communicating would be to use specific comparisons instead of "like."\n3. You know - this phrase is also a filler word that doesn\'t add much value to the conversation beyond indicating that you expect the listener to be familiar with what you\'re talking about. It can sometimes create uncertainty and ambiguity in a conversation, especially when used repeatedly or without context. A clearer way of communicating would be to use specific examples or explanations instead of "you know."\n4. Very/really [adjective] - these intensifiers are often used to make statements stronger, but they can become overused and redundant if used excessively. Using more precise language and descriptive adjectives that add meaning to the conversation is a clearer way of communicating than simply repeating "very" or "really."\n5. Stuff/things - these vague placeholders are often used when speaking about objects or concepts without providing specific details. They can make communication less effective as they don\'t provide enough context for the listener to fully understand what is being discussed. A clearer way of communicating would be to use more precise language and describe the object or concept in detail instead of using "stuff" or "things."\n6. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles as nouns - these verbs can sometimes make sentences less clear when used improperly as they don\'t always function grammatically as nouns. Using more precise language and defining the context of the verb in a sentence is a clearer way of communicating than using vague verbal forms.', '\n\n']

iteration 4: 
 [3, ' It\'s correct that in colloquial English, some phrases are commonly used but may not add significant meaning to the conversation. Here are five examples:\n\n1. I mean: This phrase is often added after a statement or question to clarify what was previously said, but it can sometimes be redundant and confusing if overused. For instance, "I meant that..." or simply rephrase the sentence for clarity instead of using "I mean."\n2. Like and you know: These filler words are common in informal speech and don\'t add much meaning to a conversation when used excessively. They can be replaced with more precise language to make communication clearer. For example, say "similar to" instead of "like," or use specific examples rather than "you know."\n3. Very/really [adjective]: Intensifiers like very and really are commonly overused in English conversation. They can emphasize the strength of an adjective but may become redundant if used excessively, as in, "This is a very big house" or "He\'s a really nice guy." Instead, use strong language that accurately describes the situation without needing to add intensifiers.\n4. Stuff and things: These placeholder terms lack specificity when used alone and can hinder clear communication if not given proper context. For example, instead of saying "We need to collect some stuff," specify what type of items are needed by using a more precise term or description.\n5. Verbs as nouns: Using verbs (such as learning) as nouns in place of their corresponding noun forms can make sentences less clear and lead to misunderstandings if not used appropriately. For instance, instead of "We need to focus on the learning process," use a more precise term like "knowledge acquisition" or "skills development." This will ensure that communication is accurate and effective.', '\n\n']

I mean: This phrase is used to clarify what was previously said, but it can also add unnecessary complexity to the conversation if overused. It suggests that there may have been some ambiguity or confusion in the previous statement, which might not always be the case. Instead of using "I mean," try being clear and direct from the start.\n2. Like and You know: These are filler words used to soften language, add emphasis, or indicate agreement with what someone else has said. While they don\'t necessarily detract from meaning in small doses, excessive use can make conversation seem less polished and more disjointed. Try eliminating these words when possible and focusing on clear communication instead.\n3. Very/really followed by an adjective: Intensifiers like "very" or "really" are used to emphasize the degree of something, but they can become redundant if overused. For example, saying "I\'m really very hungry" adds little meaning beyond simply stating that you\'re hungry. Instead, try using more descriptive language or focusing on specific details to convey your point effectively.\n4. Stuff and things: These are vague placeholders used in conversation when we don\'t have the precise words at our disposal. However, they can detract from meaning if overused without context. Be as clear and specific as possible when communicating, using accurate language that conveys exactly what you mean to say.\n5. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles: While these verbs have their place in English grammar, excessive use can make sentences less clear and more difficult for the listener/reader to understand.

 [5, ' You are correct in identifying some common phrases and words that are often overused in human conversation. I\'ll provide a brief explanation for each point:\n\n1. "I mean": People use this phrase to clarify what they meant by their previous statement or to add more detail, but it can sometimes create confusion instead of clearing things up. It is best to be clear and concise from the start rather than adding complexity with "I mean."\n2. "Like" and "You know": These are filler words that don\'t contribute much meaning to a conversation when used excessively. They may indicate agreement or uncertainty but can also make speech sound less polished.\n3. "Very" or "really" followed by an adjective: Intensifiers like these are meant to emphasize the strength of a statement, but they become redundant if overused with every sentence as it dilutes their impact. Use them sparingly and effectively for maximum effect.\n4. “Stuff” and “things": These words can be used as placeholders when discussing abstract or complex topics without providing specific context or details, making conversations less clear rather than adding value to the discussion. It\'s always better to clarify what you mean exactly instead of using vague terms like "stuff" or "things."\n5. Verbs ending with "-ing" or past participles as nouns: Using these verb forms can lead to unclear sentences, especially when they are not used appropriately in context.

 [6, ' I see your point regarding common phrases that can add unnecessary complexity to conversations or detract from clarity when used excessively. Here are some examples you provided with additional context:\n\n1. "I mean" - While it\'s natural to clarify what we mean, using this phrase too frequently can create ambiguity and confusion in a conversation. Instead of relying on "I mean," try being as clear and concise as possible from the start. For example, if you say something that might be misunderstood, pause and restate it more clearly rather than saying "what I mean is..." or "let me clarify what I meant before."\n2. Filler words like "like" and "you know" - These words don\'t add any real value to a conversation but can make us sound less confident in our communication. Try eliminating them as much as possible, and focus on speaking clearly and directly instead of using these filler phrases to buy time or indicate uncertainty.\n3. Intensifiers like "very" or "really" - While intensifiers can add emphasis to a statement, they\'re often overused and may not be necessary at all. Try focusing on making your statements clear and unambiguous instead of relying on intensifiers to make them stronger or more impactful.\n4. Vague placeholders like "stuff" and "things" - Using these terms without context can weaken a statement, so it\'s important to be as specific as possible when communicating with others. Instead of saying things like "we need to do some stuff," try being more precise about what actions are required or which tasks need to be completed.\n5. Verbs ending in "-ing" or past participles - While these verbs can function as nouns, they may not always be the most effective way to communicate a point clearly and succinctly. For example, instead of saying "we\'re experiencing some learning challenges," it might be clearer to say "we have difficulty understanding certain concepts."\n\nBy being mindful of these common communication habits and striving for clarity in our conversations, we can make our messages more effective and impactful while reducing unnecessary complexity or ambiguity.', '\n\n']

It\'s often better to rephrase instead of adding this phrase in every sentence.\n2.
