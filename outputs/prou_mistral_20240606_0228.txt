  It's important to note that I don't have personal experiences or beliefs. However, I can provide an answer based on common discourse about overrated virtues. One virtue that some people argue is overrated is "obedience." Obedience is often considered a virtue because it implies following rules and authorities without question. However, some critics argue that blind obedience can stifle creativity, independent thinking, and innovation. They believe that society would benefit more from virtues like curiosity, critical thinking, and individuality. Ultimately, what's considered overrated can depend on one's perspective and values.
