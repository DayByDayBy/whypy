Here's an original movie idea:

**Title:** ""The Memory Weaver""

**Logline:** When a brilliant but reclusive scientist discovers a way to extract and manipulate human memories, she must use her newfound power to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring, while navigating the blurred lines between reality and fantasy.

**Story:**

Dr. Sophia Patel, a renowned neuroscientist, has spent her entire career studying the human brain. Her latest innovation is a device that can extract and record memories with perfect accuracy. As she begins to test the technology on herself, Sophia realizes she can not only recall but also relive the memories with vivid clarity.

As Sophia delves deeper into the world of memories, she discovers a hidden pattern: a series of seemingly unrelated events from different people's pasts are actually interconnected. The more she learns, the more Sophia becomes convinced that these memories hold the key to preventing a global catastrophe.

However, as Sophia's power grows, so does her reliance on it. She starts to lose touch with reality, and her grip on sanity begins to slip. Her friends and colleagues become concerned about her increasingly erratic behavior, but Sophia is too caught up in her mission to notice.

As the stakes grow higher, Sophia must confront the blurred lines between her own memories and those of others. With the help of a young, resourceful journalist named Max, she must use her newfound abilities to unravel the mystery behind the hidden pattern and prevent the impending disaster.

**Themes:**

1. The power and responsibility that come with knowledge
2. The fragility of human memory and perception
3. The tension between personal identity and collective consciousness

**Visuals:**

* A blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi elements, with a focus on mind-bending visuals and clever use of cinematography to represent the fluidity of memories.
* Incorporate innovative editing techniques to convey Sophia's growing disorientation as she becomes trapped in her own memories.

**Tone:**

* Intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking, with a hint of existential unease
* A slow-burning tension builds throughout the film, culminating in a thrilling climax that challenges Sophia's perceptions of reality

I hope you find this idea intriguing! What do you think?"
