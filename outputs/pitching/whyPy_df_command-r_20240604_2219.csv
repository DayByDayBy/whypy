Title: ""Time Loop"" 

In a small rural town, a group of high school students discover an abandoned old clock tower that has the power to send them back in time. But there's a twist: every time they travel back, they awaken to find themselves repeating the same day over and over, like groundhog day. Each time they wake up, they remember the previous day's events, and can act differently, but cannot change the outcome of that 'perfectly played out' day. 

The main character, 17-year old Alex, realizes that there's a mysterious anomaly attached to this phenomenon when he starts to uncover a pattern and sees glimpses of a crime that happens every time the day repeats. He and his friends must figure out the puzzle behind the crime, and ultimately, how to break free from this strange time loop. 

The movie would combine elements of a thrilling mystery, with an unexpected coming-of-age angle as the characters' repeated experiences of the same day help them reflect on their lives, relationships, and future aspirations, almost like a second chance at life. The time travel element adds a unique twist, as the repetition forces the teens to confront the idea that some things are destined to happen, while also realizing the power they have to change their own futures. 

With the right balance of suspense, humor, and heartfelt moments, ""Time Loop"" could offer a fresh take on the time travel genre, while also delivering an engaging and memorable story."
