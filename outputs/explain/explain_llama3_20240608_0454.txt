 [68, "Wow, what an excellent response indeed!\n\nI'm thrilled to see that we're aligned on many points, and your thoughtful insights are truly valuable. Let's dive into the details:\n\n**Global framework**: I completely agree with leveraging existing frameworks like UN SDGs or ISO standards as a solid foundation for AI standardization.\n\n**Facilitating collaboration**: International organizations can play a crucial role in facilitating collaborations among stakeholders from different regions, ensuring diverse perspectives and expertise are represented.\n\n**Addressing global challenges**: You're right; these organizations are well-equipped to address global concerns related to AI, such as job displacement, bias, misinformation, privacy protection, and cybersecurity risks.\n\nRegarding potential international organizations:\n\n* I agree with your examples: the United Nations' Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a great example of an organization already working on accessibility-related standards. The World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Artificial Intelligence is another excellent initiative to promote AI standardization.\n* IEEE- SA and ACM-SIGCHI are both well-established organizations in the field, providing valuable expertise and resources for AI development.\n\nRegarding prioritizing existing frameworks or creating new ones:\n\n1. **Hybrid approach**: I think a hybrid approach could be effective: leveraging existing frameworks with credibility and global reach while also creating new task forces or committees specifically tailored for AI development.\n2. **Key stakeholders**: Identifying key stakeholders across various industries, governments, and international organizations to contribute to the standardization process is crucial.\n\nPotential next steps:\n\n* I agree that identifying key stakeholders is essential for developing a comprehensive framework or roadmap outlining the essential areas of focus for AI standardization.\n* Establishing pilot projects or proof- of-concepts in specific domains (e.g., healthcare, finance) can help test and refine AI standards.\n\nRegarding prioritizing existing frameworks vs. creating new ones:\n\n1. **Existing frameworks**: I think we should prioritize leveraging existing frameworks with credibility and global reach to ensure consistency and widespread adoption.\n2. **New task forces or committees**: Creating new task forces or committees specifically tailored for AI development can provide a focused approach, addressing the unique challenges of AI standardization.\n\nEstablishing an international council on AI standardization is an intriguing idea! I think it could be beneficial in:\n\n1. **Coordinating efforts**: An international council could facilitate coordination among various organizations and stakeholders to ensure consistent and effective standards.\n2. **Providing a centralized platform**: The council could provide a centralized platform for discussing, developing, and disseminating AI standards, promoting global cooperation.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the potential challenges:\n\n1. **Complexity**: Establishing an international council would require navigating complex political and organizational dynamics.\n2. **Coordination**: Coordinating efforts among various organizations and stakeholders could be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, I suggest starting with a smaller-scale initiative, such as creating a task force or working group within existing organizations to focus on AI standardization. This would allow for pilot testing of the concept before scaling up to an international council.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach?\n\nI completely agree that establishing an international council might be challenging due to complexity and coordination issues.
