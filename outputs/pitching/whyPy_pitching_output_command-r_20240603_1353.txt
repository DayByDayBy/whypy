 Here's an original movie idea with a unique twist: 

*Light Years Away* 

The story follows a young astronaut who volunteers for a solo mission to explore the outer reaches of space. The goal is to gather critical data on an enigmatic planet situated near a distant star, one that has thus far been unexplored. The journey itself is planned to take decades, and during this time, the astronaut's body undergoes strange mutations as he travels further away from the Earth's protective shield. 

The twist comes when he finally reaches the planet and discovers it's inhabited by an advanced civilization, one that thrives on a significantly slower timescale than humans. The astronauts' physical changes enable him to experience this slower pace, allowing him to interact with the locals and learn their ways. 

As he immerses himself in this new culture, decades pass by on this planet — each day marked by profound rituals and meaningful connections — yet back on Earth, centuries have gone by. When he eventually returns to a vastly changed home world, he must reckon with the notion that his mission has aged him beyond the lifespan of most humans, and his own personal connections are now virtually non-existent. 

The film can delve into themes of loneliness, the price of exploration, the elastic nature of time, and our constant pursuit to understand the universe. 

This idea blends elements of science fiction with a unique twist on the concept of time, offering a fresh storyline within the genre and an intriguing premise for viewers.
