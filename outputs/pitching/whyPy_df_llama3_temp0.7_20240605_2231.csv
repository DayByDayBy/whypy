Title: ""The Last Memory""

Logline: When a brilliant but reclusive scientist discovers a way to record and relive human memories, she must navigate the blurred lines between reality and fantasy as her own memories begin to fade away.

Story:

Dr. Emma Taylor is a leading expert in the field of neuroscience, with a specialty in memory formation and retrieval. After years of tireless research, she finally succeeds in developing a device that can record and relive human memories with perfect clarity. The implications are staggering - the potential for treating amnesia, PTSD, and other memory-related disorders is enormous.

As Emma begins to test her invention on willing subjects, she starts to notice something strange. The more memories she records, the more her own memories begin to fade away. At first, it's just small things - where she left her keys, what she had for breakfast - but soon it's bigger chunks of her past that are disappearing.

As Emma struggles to understand and combat this phenomenon, she realizes that her invention has created a feedback loop - the more memories she records, the more they're erasing from her own mind. Her grip on reality begins to slip, and she must navigate the blurred lines between what's real and what's just a memory.

Complications arise when Emma's colleagues begin to suspect that something is wrong with her, and her invention is stolen by a rival scientist who intends to use it for nefarious purposes. As Emma's memories continue to fade away, she must confront the possibility that she may never regain them - or even remember who she once was.

Themes:

* The power and fragility of human memory
* The ethics of playing with fire when it comes to our own minds
* The struggle to maintain one's sense of identity in the face of uncertainty

Visuals:

* A blend of sci-fi elements (e.g. futuristic recording devices, neural implants) and psychological thriller tropes (e.g. Emma's increasing paranoia, the blurring of reality)
* Innovative uses of color and lighting to represent Emma's memories as they fade away
* A sense of claustrophobia and disorientation as Emma's grip on reality begins to slip

Casting:

* Emma Taylor: A complex, nuanced performance from an actress like Emma Stone or Saoirse Ronan would be perfect for the role. She'd need to convey a sense of intelligence, determination, and vulnerability.
* The rival scientist: Someone like Benedict Cumberbatch or Tom Hiddleston would bring the necessary level of smarmy sophistication to the role.

Overall, I think ""The Last Memory"" has the potential to be a thought-provoking, visually stunning film that explores some really interesting themes. It's a movie that could appeal to fans of sci-fi, psychological thrillers, and even romantic dramas - as long as you're okay with a healthy dose of existential crisis thrown in for good measure!"
