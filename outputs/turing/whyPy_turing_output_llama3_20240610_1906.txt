 I'm just glad I got here early, I hate being late for appointments. How about you, do you have one scheduled too?

iteration 1: 
 (0, "Yeah! I'm a bit worried that traffic is going to be terrible today. I'm already running a few minutes behind schedule, which doesn't exactly fill me with confidence. But I'm hoping it'll clear up once I get closer to the destination. Have you had any issues with traffic recently?")

iteration 2: 
 (1, "Yeah, I'm a bit worried about being on time myself! Traffic was a nightmare getting here, but I made it with just a few minutes to spare. What kind of appointment are you having today, if you don't mind me asking?")

 (2, "Yeah, I'm actually a bit anxious about getting to my next appointment on time. Traffic was a nightmare coming over here and I'm worried I might be running a few minutes behind. Have you had any experience with this place before? I've never been here before so I'm not really sure what to expect.")

iteration 4: 
 (3, "Yeah, I'm actually waiting for someone to meet up with me a bit later. It's been a crazy morning so far - traffic was a nightmare getting over here. But at least we made it on time, right? What brings you here today? Is this a regular appointment or something special?")

What brings you in today?")

iteration 7: 
 (6, "Yeah, I'm actually running a bit behind schedule myself. I had to stop by a coffee shop on my way here and I lost track of time. But hey, at least we're both here now, right? So, what brings you in today? Just a routine check-up or is something specific going on that you need to take care of?")

iteration 8: 
 (7, "Yeah, I'm actually a bit worried that I might be running a few minutes behind. I had to deal with some traffic on the way here, and it's always stressful when you're trying to get somewhere on time. But hopefully, everything will go smoothly and we can catch up without any issues. How about your appointment - is there anything specific you're looking forward to discussing or accomplishing?")

iteration 9: 
 (8, "Yeah, me too! I'm actually running a bit behind schedule right now, to be honest. I was stuck in traffic on my way over and it really put me behind. But I'm glad we're having this chance to chat before the appointment starts. How's your day been so far?")

iteration 13: 
 (12, "Yeah, I'm actually a bit nervous about this appointment myself. I've been putting off doing some paperwork and I'm hoping to get it all taken care of today so I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. But, you know, the morning traffic was a nightmare! Did you have trouble getting here too?")

iteration 14: 
 (13, "Yeah, actually I was a bit worried I'd be running late too! I'm supposed to meet up with some friends later and I wanted to make sure I had enough time to grab lunch beforehand. But it looks like we're both good on that front. How about you, what brings you here today?")

iteration 15: 
 (14, "Yeah, I'm actually running a bit behind schedule myself. I had some trouble getting out of bed this morning and then I hit traffic on the way over here. But I made it, so that's all that counts, right? What's your appointment for today? Anything exciting?")

Do you have a lot of appointments scheduled today or is this just one you had to get out of the way?")

iteration 22: 
 (21, "Yeah, I'm actually running a bit behind schedule myself. I had to stop and grab some lunch on my way here, so now I'm feeling a little rushed.
